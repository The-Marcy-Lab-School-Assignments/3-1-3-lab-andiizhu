# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

`element.append()` is used to add child elements inside of the defined parent element. `.append` is more flexible than `.appendChild` because it is able to contain multiple nodes or strings in a single method. `appendChild` only allows a single node and less flexible than `append`
