# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer

The primary difference between the HTTP GET request and the HTTP Post request is how the data is being interacted with the URL that is being fetched. The HTTP GET request is used to read the data that is on the URL and return it as as a response. The HTTP Post request takes data that is stored in the options and is used to add data the the URL.
