# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

Semantic elements refers to the HTML tags that provides a structure for information and also conveys the meaning or purpose to the element. An example of a semantic element is `<h1>`. The `<h1>` tag creates the largest heading and is used to contain the most important heading on the page. An non-semantic does not provide any meaning or structure to the information that it is holding. An example of a non-semantic element is `<div>`. When you create a `<div>` it usually does not store anything, but is used to better structure other semantic tags.
