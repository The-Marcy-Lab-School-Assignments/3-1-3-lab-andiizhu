# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information _directly_ into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer

The danger between insering user entered information directly into the DOM unescaped is that they can affect our existing code. For example, if someone inputs code to the input, it would affect the functions that are using the form Data as the parameters. The symbols that needs to be escaped are `<`,`>`, `&`, `"`, `'`.

So this is a good answer. As for the language I would add something to the effect of:
"this exposes the application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that can steal data, impersonate users, and alter website functionality"
