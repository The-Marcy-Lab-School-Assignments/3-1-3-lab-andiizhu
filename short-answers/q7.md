# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. One benefit of using the first option is modularization. Essentially, it supports the ability to use export and imports on the src file. This allows functions to be better organizied and promotes reusuability.

2. Another benefit of using the first option is that modules are executed only after the HTML elements are fully processed.
