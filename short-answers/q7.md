# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. One benefit of using the first option is modularization. Essentially, it supports the ability to use export and imports on the src file. This allows functions to be better organizied and promotes reusuability.

2. Another benefit of using the first option is that modules are executed only after the HTML elements are fully processed.

This is correct, I would adjust some of the language here.

1. "it supports the ability to use export and imports on the src file." :
What I would change here is "to use export..." to "use `export` and `import` statements", and I would change the "on the src file" to "allowing functions and variables to be better organized and promoting reusability"
2. For the second answer, I would just adjust it to read as the following:
"Another benefit of using the first option is that module scripts are deferred by default. This means they are executed only after the HTML elements are fully parsed, which can improve page load performance."

The change here makes sure that you use the term "defer", and why that matters. Although "fully processed" is technically correct, the push is work on technical communication and using the correct terms. Clearly you understand the concepts and how they work.
