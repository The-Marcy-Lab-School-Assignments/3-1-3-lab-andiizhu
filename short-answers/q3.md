# Question

Translate the following code into `async/await` please.

```js
const getAllUsers = () => {
	return fetch("https://example.com/users")
		.then((r) => r.json())
		.then((users) => {
			console.log("users:", users);
			return users;
		})
		.catch(console.warn);
};
```

Make sure to keep all variable and function names the same. The function must behave the same way.

# Answer

```js
const getAllUsers = async () => {
	try {
		const r = await fetch("https://example.com/users");
		if (!response.ok) new Error(`No response provided.`);
		const users = r.json();
		console.log(`users: ${users}`);
		return users;
	} catch (error) {
		console.warn(error);
		return null;
	}
};
```

This is solid, the issue here is that you were asked to keep the variable and function names the same. Can you see where you did not do this.
